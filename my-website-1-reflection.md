Paste a link to your [USERNAME].github.io repository.

Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.

Jump onto github then press the "+" in the top right corner to create your repository. To clone this to your local server, copy the http address provided, hop into your command line (moving to the directory you want the repository in), and type in git clone <the http address you just copied>. Now your repository is cloned onto your computer!

Describe what open source means.

Open source means the softwares code is accessible by anyone and can be viewed and seen by even those not working on that code or responsible for its creation. Depending on the licence, open source code can also be used / modified by others as well.

What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?

I like open source to a certain degree. I think technology will advance faster if more developers / companies opened up their source code and shared groundbreaking idea. I do believe though that for these ideas, the developers behind them should get paid (I feel similarly about artists who produce art). How they are paid though matters less to me (e.g., they do not necessarily need to charge for the access to their code).

Assess the importance of using licenses.

Using licenses (the right license especially) is important for protecting your code and ensuring what you've produced is used by others in exactly the way you want.

What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?

No aha moments for me in this challenge. I do think all of this practice with git though is making me much better at git and the command line which has been a great way to feel!

Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.

Nope! Only used the resources provided in the challenge :)
