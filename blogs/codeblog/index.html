            <h2 class="blog-post-title">Welcome to my Coding Lesson Plan!</h2>
            <p class="blog-post-meta">February 26, 2016 by <a href="about.html">Sydney</a></p>

            <p>Are you interested in learning how to code / program, but you have no technical experience? Or find the world of learning to code overwhelming (and sometimes expensive)? Have you tried to learn to code before and given up out of sheer frustration? Are you excited to learn and ready to become a programmer, but feel powerless to achieve your goal?</p>

            <br>

            <p>A year ago, I was in a similar place. </p>

            <br>

            <p>I had been working in Silicon Valley in a non-technical role for almost a year. All my friends (and my boyfriend) were software engineers. I saw how powerful knowing computer science / programming could be and knew I wanted to be in tech.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Yet, every time I tried to learn, I'd hit a wall. There were enough free resources in obvious places to teach me the basics of a few languages, but, after I had exhausted these, everything else I found was geared towards experts / those who already knew how to code professionally. I was unable to parse through these resources and my growth stalled.</p>

            <br>

            <p><img src="imgs/hittingwall.gif"></p>

            <br>

            <p>I was willing to work hard to learn, but nothing I could find bridged me from those beginner stages to an experienced software engineer. Eventually, I signed up for a dev bootcamp (<a href="http://devbootcamp.com/">DevBootcamp</a>). I had / am having a great experience in DBC, but know that its price (over 10k in tuition and lost earnings for the 10 weeks of onsite in the program) can be prohibitive for others.</p>

            <br>

            <p>Now that I've finally begun to crack this programming nut, I wanted to find a way to help those who don't have a bootcamp like I did to help them. So, I've decided to write an extensive lesson plan with links to only FREE materials that can take you from 0 to 100 when it comes to coding / software engineering.</p>

            <br>

            <p>NOTE:
              <ol>
              <li>This guide is mainly for MAC users although most of the materials will also work for Windows</li>
              <li>I plan to update this guide periodically as I learn</li>
              <li>This is only ONE track for learning some programming concepts. Obviously, there are a lot of other ways to go. I am mostly mimicking the way I learned.</li>
              <li>This is a WORK IN PROGRESS ... feel free to send me feedback / notes (email me at <a href="mailto:srossmanreich@gmail.com?" target="_top">srossmanreich@gmail.com</a> or <a href="https://twitter.com/Sydkick">tweet at me</a>)</li></ol>
