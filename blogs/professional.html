      <p>It's finally time to reflect on actually building a website. I've learned a lot from the process.</p>

      <p><strong>The Good</strong></p>

      <p>Making a website is NOT difficult. Even if you suck at html and css, even if you aren't good at design or don't know what you want to put on your site, you really can do it. Particularly if you know enough html / css to go online and grab existing templates (e.g., via <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a>). I was also surprised how generous github is with their free hosting. As long as you don't mind having their name in your url, there is no need to buy / hook up a domain name! All in all, getting this sucker online was very doable.</p>

      <p><strong>The Challenges</strong></p>

      <p>Making a site isn't all a walk in the park though. It is super easy to get caught up in the nitty gritty of your site and soon hours have gone by and all you've done is add one half-working interactive JS element. Connected to this, I don't think the resources available online to help you take your website from static to interactive are all that great ... I mostly spent my hours surfing on the web more confused and discouraged. Timeboxing is definitely important to help manage this. Also: asking for feedback (and not being afraid to show others your unfinished project).</p>
