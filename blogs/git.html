        First official week of Dev Bootcamp = ALMOST DONE (I say almost because technically writing this blog post is a week 1 assignment ;))
      </p>

         <strong>Expectation =/= Reality</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For some reason, I expected phase 0 of DBC to be somewhat slow (a lot of easing into html, engineering empathy, the tools we're going to use to interface with DBC staff), but instead the program threw us right into git, github, and the command line. I have to say I have been pleasantly surprised by this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pace is fast and there is a ton to learn, but I already feel like I am beginning to become an engineer (I feel comfortable with the command line - what????). We've learned how to organize our files for coding (and really anything else) as well as use git for version control (although all my engineering friends seem to hate git ... I am beginning to understand why they might be frustrated although I like understanding the language!). And it is pretty incredible that I finally have things in my GitHub and understand how to get my code / files / repositories in there! Wahoo!

        What a week! Can't wait for more!

        <strong>Takeaways for new programmers</strong>
      </p>

      <p>
        <ul>
          <li>Learn git! It isn't too painful (only a few commands need to be learned) and it will really help with your version control and tracking changes</li>
          <li>GitHub is a great place to store your code (I prefer it so much more than simply keeping everything isolated solely on your local server)</li>
        </ul>
