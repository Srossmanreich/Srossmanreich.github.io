      <p>So what IS Rails?</p>

      <p>This might be embarrassing to admit since I am eight weeks into DBC, but I actually don't know what Rails is .... I know it has something to do with Ruby (and I like Ruby!), but not much else. So this week, I've decided to find out!</p>

      <p>After a little bit of time on the web, I've discovered that Rails is a library that adds a lot of power to the standard Ruby language / library. But Rails isn't *just* a library; it is more like a framework that helps programmers build websites with ruby. But, how does it do this? And here is where it gets interesting ...</p>

      <p>So Rails actually COMBINES Ruby with OTHER languages (namely, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript) to create web apps. OR software libraries that make building really involved sites much easier.</p>

      <p>One of the most surprising things I learned about Rails is how connected, active, and communal the community around Rails is. (Seriously it was mentioned everywhere!). A big core value of the Rails / Ruby community is open-source software (which means folks can access it for free and easily).</p>

      <p>Unfortunately the downside of Rails for a post like this, is there really isn't a one-size-fits-all code example of what Rails is ... because it is a lot of things: tools, software, libraries, etc.</p>

      <p>I have to say --- I am so excited to jump in and can't wait to start with Rails!</p>
