      <p>Recursion!</p>

      <p>For my next go-around at week 8 (see: surgery *sad*), I decided to tackle recursion. We've heard a lot about this concept recently (in that many challenges tell us to avoid recursion). I also remember *doing* a recursion challenge as a part of my DBC interview. So, given all this, I decided it might be a good time to actually learn more about what recursion is.</p>

      <p>In its simplest terms (in the context of coding), recursion is the process by which you use a function or expression that calls itself as part of its operation. Okay, but what does that mean?</p>

      <p>Best to use an example! After some googling, it looks like the most common example of recursion is used for expressing the fibonacci Sequence. The fibbonacci sequence is simply a series of numbers in math that starts with 0 and 1. Each subsequent term is equal to the sum of the two terms before it. So, after 0 and 1 in the sequence comes ... 1 again (because 0 + 1 = 1). Then the next number would be 2 (1+1) and so on. Thus the first ten digits of the series are: 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, and 34.</p>

      <p>But how might we express this using recursion? Well below is one answer:</p>

      <img src="imgs/recursfib.png">

      <p>Now what is happening here though? Basically this method will print the term in the fibonacci sequence at the position you specify (note: just like with ruby indexing, the first position is represented with 0 and so on). The output looks like this (notice how these are the same first 10 terms I specified earlier!):</p>

      <img src="imgs/recursfib2.png">

      <p>It can be a bit tricky visualizing how the method actually functions though. So let's parse through the code step by step: </p>

      <ul>
        <li>First we define a function (fibonacci) and give it a parameter (this case a number that represents the position in the sequence whose term we want printed to the console).</li>
        <li>Next we say, if the number is 0 or 1, just give us back that number.</li>
        <li>The tricky part: if the number is not 0 or 1 we want it to run the fibonacci method again on that number - 1 AND that number - 2 added together and return whatever this is.</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Okay, so that's confusing, but let's think about it in concrete terms with a sample number. Let's use the number 6! Now we know the index 6 is actually the 7th term in our sequence (because our function, like indices, begins with 0 as the first term). Remember what our 7th term in the fibonacci sequence was? --> 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 --- so we are looking for 8! Now let's dig in:</p>

      <ul>
        <li>Our fibonacci method takes 6 --> and it isn't 1 or 0 so we jump into the else statement within the function</li>
        <li>Now we need to return fibonacci (6 - 1) + fibonacci (6 - 2) OR fibonacci (5) + fibonacci (4) --> but this means we now have to start over with 5 in our fibonacci function and 4 in our fibonacci function</li>
        <li>And so on ...</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Here is a diagram showing how all this ends up working out:</p>

      <img src="imgs/fibimage.png">

      <p>See ... not too bad? Okay, maybe it is. The most challenging part of writing recursions is dealing with all the layering (visualized by my diagram above). I find it to be really helpful if, when you know you might need to do a recursion, to start with the practical applications. So, if I were tackling this problem over again, I would say, I want to put in 6 and get out 8 and this is what would need to happen in between. Hopefully, I'd notice the pattern of taking the fibonacci sequence position just 1 or 2 less than the position I'm at and be able to turn it into a recursion. Drawing it helps (or at least helps me).</p>

      <p>I have a feeling recursions are a big part of method / function defining in coding languages. Hopefully practice will be what makes perfect!</p>
