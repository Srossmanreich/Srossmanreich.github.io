#3.5 Reflection

# What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?

Paddings, borders, and margins are really hard to use and manipulate. Constantly refreshing the page to see how what you are doing is impacting how that page looks is very important!

# What did you learn about CSS positioning?

Again: trial and error is key. Also, google is your friend!

# What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?

I thought anything related to the text, links, or lists was easy. Positioning was definitely my hardest challenge (and, surprisingly, getting the colors to work!)

# What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?

As I mentioned: trial and error is so important --- sometimes testing out what I was sure wouldn't work ended up revealing the answer. And, google google google.
